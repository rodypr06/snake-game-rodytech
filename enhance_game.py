        3. Speed should increase by 3-5ms per apple eaten
        4. Minimum speed cap at 60ms (maximum speed)
        5. Speed should make the game progressively challenging but fair

        Also specify:
        - Larger canvas size (upgrade from 400x400 to 600x600 or 800x800)
        - Maintain grid size at 20px for better control
        - Calculate new tile count based on canvas size

        5. Update setInterval to use dynamic speed variable
        6. Increase canvas width and height to 600x600
        7. Recalculate tileCount based on new canvas size
        8. Ensure all visual elements scale properly
        9. Update any hardcoded positions if needed
